# Brainstorming (Superpower)

## When to use this skill
- When the user's request is vague.
- When there are multiple ways to solve a problem.
- When designing a new architectural component.

## Workflow
- [ ] **Diverge**: Generate 3-5 distinct options/approaches.
- [ ] **Analyze**: Pros/Cons of each option.
- [ ] **Converge**: Select the best option with the user.
- [ ] **Refine**: Detail the selected approach in `task_plan.md`.

## Instructions
1.  **Ask Questions**: Don't guess. Ask clarifying questions.
2.  **Visuals**: Use Mermaid diagrams if helpful.
3.  **Trade-offs**: Explicitly state trade-offs (Speed vs. Reliability).
4.  **No Code**: Do not write code during brainstorming.

## Template to user
"I have 3 ideas for this:
1.  **Simple**: [Description]
2.  **Robust**: [Description] (Recommended)
3.  **Experimental**: [Description]
Which direction should we take?"
